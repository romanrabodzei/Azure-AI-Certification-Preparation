Q: You plan to develop an image processing solution that will use DALL-E as a generative AI model.

Which capability is NOT supported by the DALL-E model?
<details><summary>Show the answer</summary><p>

- **Image description**
> Image description is not a capability included in the DALL-E model, therefore, it is not a use case that can be implemented by using DALL-E, while the other three capabilities are offered by DALL-E in Azure OpenAI.

Q: Which generative AI model is used to generate images based on natural language prompts?
<details><summary>Show the answer</summary><p>

- **DALL-E**
> DALL-E is a model that can generate images from natural language. GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 can understand and generate natural language and code but not images. Embeddings can convert text into numerical vector form to facilitate text similarity. Whisper can transcribe and translate speech to text.
