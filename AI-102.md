- **Azure AI Vision Image Analysis**
> The Azure AI Vision Image Analysis service can extract a wide variety of visual features from an image. One of them is to detect adult content.
The Azure AI Face service provides AI algorithms that detect, recognize, and analyze human faces in images. Azure AI Custom Vision is an image recognition service that lets you build, deploy, and improve own image identifier models. So, while it is possible, it is not the solution with the lowest development effort. Azure AI Vision Spatial Analysis is used to ingest streaming video from cameras, extract insights, and generate events to be used by other systems.
